🎯 Project Title:

“Smart Retail Product Recommender”
A Flask-based web app that recommends similar or trending products using web scraping, APIs, and async Python.

🧠 Project Overview:

This project builds a product recommendation system for a retail website or e-commerce context. A user inputs a product (e.g., "laptop" or a product URL), and the system:

Scrapes similar products from e-commerce sites (like Amazon or Flipkart)

Uses an external API to enrich product data (ratings, reviews, descriptions)

Stores past product recommendations using file handling (JSON or CSV)

Uses async scraping and API calls for fast performance

Handles network, file, and API errors robustly

Serves results via a simple Flask web interface

📌 Use Case:

A customer is considering a product and wants alternatives based on:

Price

Brand

Features

Popularity

The app shows similar products scraped from the web or recommended using data from APIs.

🔧 Key Features:
1. Search Interface (Flask)

User enters:

Product name (e.g., "Samsung TV")

OR pastes a URL (e.g., Amazon product link)

2. Web Scraping (Async)

Scrape similar products from e-commerce sites using aiohttp or playwright.

Extract:

Product title

Price

Rating

Features/specs

3. API Integration

Use a product recommendation API like:

DummyJSON

SerpAPI
 (for Google Shopping results)

Clearbit Logo API
 for brand enrichment

Fetch:

Related or trending products

Product descriptions

Images or brand logos

4. Recommendation Logic

Based on scraped/API data, recommend alternatives using:

Price similarity

Brand match

Rating threshold

OR random trending products (if product is new)

5. File Handling

Save each recommendation result into:

recommendations.json

OR per-user CSV logs

Allow download as a report

6. Async Python

Run multiple scraping/API requests concurrently using asyncio + aiohttp

Speed up recommendations by parallelizing tasks

7. Error Handling

Handle:

Invalid product names or URLs

Scraping failures or selectors not found

API failures or rate limits

File read/write errors

Show fallback recommendations or “no data found” gracefully

📊 Sample Output (on UI):

User enters: "Samsung 55 inch 4K TV"

Recommendations shown:

Title	Price	Rating	Brand
LG 55" 4K UHD Smart TV	$599	4.5	LG
Sony Bravia 55" 4K	$649	4.7	Sony
TCL 55" Roku Smart TV	$499	4.3	TCL

Option to:

Download recommendations as .csv or .json

✅ Skills You’ll Practice:

Building a real-world recommendation engine

Handling asynchronous I/O

Working with external APIs and live scraping

Managing file I/O and persistent storage

Building a Flask app from scratch

Writing robust error-handling logic

🚀 Bonus Ideas (Advanced):

Add a product comparison view (price vs features)

Use vector similarity (e.g., via text embeddings) for smarter matching

Add user login + history tracking

Integrate a price drop alert system
